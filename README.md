# random-bio-models
Just some random bio models!

# Rules
1. This repo is expected to be cleanly maintained. All variable names must be appropriate (nothing like a and b), and all codes must include comments and should be well documented.
2. Please do mention the packages used as a comment in the beginning of your code file, and give a short description as to what it does.
3. Name the file appropriately, and make sure not to give garbage names, like meowmeow, for example.

These rules will probably be subject to change, so look out for that!
Note: All commits must be appropriately named too, maybe even add description, and if you want someone to verify it, do mention it.

# Note
All initial commits must be made in the test-code branch. I will merge it with the master branch after the code passes checks.

Happy coding >w<!
